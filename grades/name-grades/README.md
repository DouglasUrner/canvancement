# Add a student's name to their Grades page
This is a user script that will add a user's name and student ID number to their grades page.

## Quick Install
1. Install and enable the [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) browser extension
2. Install the [names-grades.users.js](https://github.com/jamesjonesmath/canvancement/raw/master/grades/name-grades/name-grades.user.js) file

## About
The page that displays grades for all of a user's courses does not display their name. In higher education, this might be a privacy concern if the student left it lying around or even a FERPA violation if the teacher left it where others could see it.

However, some people want the name there so they can print the page and then distribute the grades to the student or their parents.

The closest thing to a name that the page displays is a breadcrumb, but it contains the **name of the person viewing the page**, not the name of the person whose grades are displayed. When a student views their grades, this is expected, but when an administrator visits the page, it shows the administrator's name. As part of the breadcrumb, it doesn't print with the page, so what it says doesn't really help anyway.

This script changes the **Courses I'm Taking** header on the page to contain the student's name and optionally their student ID number.

## Customization
This script will automatically run on any Canvas instance hosted at ``*.instructure.com``. If you have a custom domain, then you will need to modify the `\\ @include` line to refer to your site.

There are also two additional configuration variables that you can set.
* **includeSisId** determines whether or not to include the student's SIS ID in the heading. Set ``includeSisId = false`` to disable displaying the student's ID number. The script will add the student ID in parentheses if ``includeSisId = true`` and it can find it in the user record.
* **nameOrder** is an array that allows you to specify your preference for displaying names. It scans the list and uses the first one returned by the Canvas User API. The default order is ``['short_name', 'name', 'sortable_name']``. If you want to display the names in "Last, First" form, then use ``sortable_name``. The other options should still be included, though, in case the form you want to use is missing.
